Unsupervised Algorithm -

	A. K-means, Agglomerative, DBSCAN
		K-means, Agglomerative, DBSCAN methods are applied on DonorsChoose Dataset to find the right number of clusters in the Dataset

	B. T-SNE
		EDA is performed on DonorsChoose Dataset and T-SNE is applied to visualize the Two clusters i.e. (Project Approved points and Project Not Approved points) in Two Dimensions
